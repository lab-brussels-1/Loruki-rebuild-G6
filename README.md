# Loruki's website development

## Group 6

Our project is based on the development of a website with 2 intra-pages based on
the website developed by Traversy Media.

We tried to give it a little extra touch in certain things.

The main objective with this project was to learn how to build from scratch a
project with the Agile methodology whilst practicing HTML and CSS.
